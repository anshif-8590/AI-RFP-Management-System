The system should include product management, stock tracking, barcode scanning, low-stock alerts, user roles, and a basic dashboard.
The estimated budget for this project is around ₹2,50,000.
We expect the final delivery within 30–40 days.
Please include any maintenance or warranty period in your proposal.
